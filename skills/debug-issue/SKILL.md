## Debug Issue

Use the knowledge graph to systematically trace and debug issues.

### Steps

1. Run `get_minimal_context(task="<bug or symptom>")` to check graph freshness,
   risk, and suggested next tools.
2. Use `semantic_search_nodes` to find code related to the issue.
3. Use `query_graph` with `callers_of` and `callees_of` to trace call chains.
4. Use `get_flow` to see full execution paths through suspected areas.
5. Run `detect_changes` to check if recent changes caused the issue.
6. Use `get_impact_radius` on suspected files to see what else is affected.
7. Read source directly once graph evidence identifies the likely failing path.

### Tips

- Check both callers and callees to understand the full context.
- Look at affected flows to find the entry point that triggers the bug.
- Recent changes are the most common source of new issues.
- Do not infer root cause from graph centrality alone; require an observed
  failing path, changed behavior, or source-level defect.

## Token Efficiency Rules
- ALWAYS start with `get_minimal_context(task="<your task>")` before any other graph tool.
- Use `detail_level="minimal"` on all calls. Only escalate to "standard" when minimal is insufficient.
- Target: complete any review/debug/refactor task in ≤5 tool calls and ≤800 total output tokens.
