# Architecture

## Pipeline overview

`dagayn` turns repository contents into a local knowledge graph through five main stages:

1. file discovery and language detection
2. parser extraction into nodes and edges
3. SQLite persistence
4. optional post-processing for flows, communities, and search indexes
5. query-time analysis for reviews, search, and refactors

## Parsing model

The fork uses Tree-sitter where possible, plus targeted fallbacks for formats that need custom handling.

Important fork-specific parser work includes:

- vendored Terraform grammar support
- vendored Markdown grammar support for directive-style comments
- notebook parsing that preserves per-cell attribution

## Storage model

Graph data is stored in SQLite. Nodes and edges carry file identity, qualified names, and extra metadata used by downstream analysis.

In dagayn-oriented workflows, registered paths are expected to be relative to the repository root. That keeps graph output stable across symlinked temp paths and portable across machines.

## Post-processing

Optional post-processing layers add:

- full-text search indexes
- communities
- execution flows
- embeddings for semantic search

## Query surfaces

The MCP layer and CLI build on the same graph store. Review, architecture, traversal, and refactor tools all read from the same local dataset.
